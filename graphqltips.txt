instead of having a __resolveType and differentiating based on fields which might be similar, you can
just return an object with __typeName set directly. useful.
e.x:

sdl:
union CourseGetResult = Found | NotFound

resolver:
courses: () => {
    return {
        __typename:"NotFound",
        message:"found"
    } 
}
this might cause a warning though. to fix that:
 const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
    resolverValidationOptions: { requireResolversForResolveType: false },
  });

  const server = new ApolloServer({
    schema,
    context
  });
